    "**Step 2:(Working with constructor)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First write a parameterless constructor with just self parameter. \n",
    "2. Then look at the different type of object creation. Does the parameter passed in the constructor vary during object creation? If yes, use constructor overloading. If no, no need to implement overloading  \n",

    "> Instance method always called through the object in driver code. They have self as a argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If no paramter is passed then it has only self as the argument. If parameter is passed then there are additional parameters.This can be LOCAL variable if only used inside that particular method. \n",
    "2. No Method Overloading. If there are multiple places where the method is called check the number of parameter passed. If all method calls have same number passed then write the function as normal. If the parameter number is different, then method overloading needs to implemented. \n",
    "3. If the method returns then there needs to be a variable or print() in the drive code where method is called from to catch. If method  does not return, you have to print something inside the function.\n",
